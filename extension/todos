TODO:
- make the ticker box look nicer, better formatting
- optimize
- figure out a better way to write html in javascript
- potentially cache tickers in a database so they can be used for other webpages later
- have the extension be triggered if the dom has changed
- turn on and off by clicking the browser action
- update z-axis of sticker to override any other popups
- figure out why facebook is fucked up
	- unsure; temp fix was to block it
- suppress default hover-over ability
- add full company names
	- got a list of it
- add news headlines tab
	- maybe change color of ticker based on sentiment analysis of news headlines
	- use the financial news api?
- actually make a readme


DONE:
- add browser action ability to turn on and off
	- weirdly still affects facebook so small workaround is to just not let the extension work on FB
- try to build a ticker check where $, (, and ) are preserved
- add loading message
- more informative 'undefined' errors
