- build ticker sticker page
- maybe make each ticker sticker into shadow dom
- clean up dependencies
- clean up code
- fix on/off (the clear local storage for all tabs)
- minify, run under google speed thing
- add google analytics
- PUBLISH

DONE:
- add browser action ability to turn on and off
	- weirdly still affects facebook so small workaround is to just not let the extension work on FB
- try to build a ticker check where $, (, and ) are preserved
- add loading message
- more informative 'undefined' errors
- suppress default hover-over ability
